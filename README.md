**Software Engineer | Systems-oriented • Integration-focused**

I build software that works across systems, with growing focus on runtime behavior and system boundaries.

### Focus Areas
- Systems-oriented software engineering
- Cross-component and cross-runtime integration
- Object-oriented design and clean architecture
- Client–server and network-adjacent systems
- ML deployment and evaluation as an engineering problem
- Data analysis to support system behavior, performance, and decisions
